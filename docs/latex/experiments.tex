\subsection{Data Sets}
Data sets used in the paper were WSJ Treebank for POS tagging and CoNLL 2003
for the NER task. I have used only a portion of the Treebank because it isn't
the full version requires a special licence. The NLTK data package includes a
$10\%$ sample of the Treebank. NER data set was used in its full form.
Although WSJ and CoNLL have  pre-determined splits for the training,
development and test sets, I have decided to merge them and then do the custom
split. Data sets were split using the $60 - 20 - 20$ ratios and random shuffling
was applied before the split.
